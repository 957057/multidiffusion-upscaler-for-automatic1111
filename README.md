Original project address https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111

This fork is based on the original project's approach and adds a demofusion plugin based on k-diffusion implementation to the stable diffusion webui, using the same approach as the original project.

Note that during use:

- Do not enable tilediffusion and demofusion at the same time
- Realistic visuals are more suitable for demofusion
- High denoising intensity is required to obtain better images
- In img2img mode, please describe your image as accurately as possible using text. If the image itself is generated by txt2img, it is recommended to use the original random seed, text, and image generation model
- Same as the original project, compatible with stablesr, controllnet, and noise inversion

If you like the project, please give me a star! ⭐
